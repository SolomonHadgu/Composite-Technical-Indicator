# Composite-Technical-Indicator
This project focuses on building a composite technical indicator by combining RSI, SMA, BBWidth, and OBV to improve the predictive accuracy of individual indicators. It applies machine learning models (Random Forest and LSTM) to forecast market signals and evaluates performance through classification metrics and trading strategy backtesting.
